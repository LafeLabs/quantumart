                simple pure 3d repreentation of 4 qubit space with 16 links and 15 angles, each link is a rectangular solid of
                size  (side,0.25Xside,0.125Xside), rotate around kickflip axis for phi and ollie impossible axis for theta
                , largest sides of each solid colored, red/blue.

                repeat for 5,6,7,8 qubits, or until memory becomes an issue in the browser, possibly 10 qubits, which is 
                1024 rectangual solids with 1023 angles of each type.

                paper on how a quantum art machine is different from a quantum computer and why this is what we
                should build, how it connects to protein folding, quantum graphic design, quantum music composition,
                evolutionary design algorithms of anything: circuits, antennas, molecules, etc. use of video rate real 
                time human interface, proposal to do so in collaboration between artists, coders, and metatron trash wizard.
