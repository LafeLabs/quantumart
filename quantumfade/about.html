        This is a graphical representation of the space spanned by a two qubit quantum computer. There are four basis states
        for two qubits, $\left|00\right>$, $\left|01\right>$, $\left|10\right>$, and $\left|00\right>$.   These represent
         the four possible observed values of the two bits.  According to quantum mechanics, each of these four values
         has both an amplitude and a phase.  The amplitude has the property that when squared it is the probability for that
         state.  The phase has a meaning that depends on the type of experiment you carry out but for the purposes of
         this representation is simply an angle between 0 and 360 degrees.  
         <p>
             The purpose of this project is to make the simplest and most intuitive possible map between graphics in a 
             web browser and states in a quantum computer.  To that end, we stack a sequence of four images, each of which 
             is from some remote link on the Web, and modify their appearance based on the state of the system.  The opacity
             of each image represents the amplitude of that state.  The angle of each image represents the phase of that state.
             As is typical in these discussions, a global phase angle is removed, setting the phase of the ground state arbitrarily to 
             zero. This fixed phase is denoted by the ground state having a rectangular shape instead of circular or elliptical, 
             as all other images do.  
             <p>
                 Opacity and rotation angle are both parameters in CSS which are easily manipulated in real time in JavaScript.
                 Thus all that is required to connect this graphical interface to a real quantum computer is a connection between 
                 what happens on the client side in a web browser and some type of physical back end.  This connection can 
                 for instance be made with any of various Python frameworks, making a real time graphical interfaces possible for 
                 the QC.  
             </p>

    Why should we wish to do this?  Another question is why should we build a quantum computer at all when the universe already 
    apparently is one?  The answer to this is of course that as with classical computers, the real purpose of the 
    machines we build is not to compute(which the Universe does fine without us) but to create information channels
    between the human mind and a computing process.  Since it is not clear what the use of a quantum computer will be, 
    in order to find out what the use is we need to build a linguistic interface between the machine and the broadest 
    possible spectrum of human minds.  The graphical/artistic language of the World Wide Web is the closest thing we've ever had 
    to a universal language. The hope is that by casting the behavior of states in Hilbert space in this language, that we can 
    build connections to systems like protein structure or circuit design which can also be both posed and solved in a 
    graphical/artistic space.  Rather than trying to figure out how to write quantum code to solve protein structures, 
    I propose that the more powerful problem to solve is to build the user interface that connects the <i>minds</i> of 
    organic chemists with Hilbert space and protein structure using web-based graphical interfaces and goes from there.

    This program is also a form of social media: you can modify the code in the window in the lower left by hand, hit the "import"
    button to import it, and can share any JSON code you build with others, as well as point the PHP version to a 
    remote text file with JSON in it to share directly a link that will populate all variables with whatever values you want.
